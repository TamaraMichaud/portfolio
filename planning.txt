// TODO: 
// figure out how to do set tasks on github.

- order job history in desktop by old to new
- set job history dates on top row as full-width (?)
- swap references for skills; everyday tech 
	- group by programming / web / database
- projects; on-hover make background more prominent --> fuck no


-- projects: remove the languages shite.  display only the code and/or blur the image
-- stretch/repeat image...

-- about-me: make the last one pop...







// (set plain bg with watermark of all tech/langs ?)

// landing page orbs declare "catch me"

// convert entire myCV.html text to json config

// Tam's tools...
	-> convert; hex to rgba // cm to inch // gram to ounce // f to c // spanish to english
	-> workouts
	-> ais
// set colour-schemes/backgrounds to changes depending on time of day...
