However, after automating as much of my bau as possible using VB-coded macros in Excel, I began to teach myself how to improve the existing UNIX shell scripts, SQL queries & XSL coding that generated the source data. This allowed me to further automate the  extraction and manipulation of account data into precise accounting reports which were soon used by several other departments within the company. And here I first fell in love with coding.",
